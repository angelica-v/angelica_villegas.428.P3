## Introduction
This is a project for Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality taught by Professor Andy Johnson. 

The goal was to create a VR environment that could be viewed in both Unity and in the Oculus Quest VR headset. This environment is based off a coffee shop and new environement to be located in the new CS building. I modeled my scene based on a fall fair theme. Somedays, you need a snack/coffee before you cast spells and make potions. When walking around the scene one is able to pick up items including but not limited to, the potions, skull, cakes, cookies, and pumpkins. Additionally, if the user touches either the coffee maker screen or the over dials an new coffee cup or a new pie (cherry/pumpkin) is spawned into the game. MakeHuman and Mixamo, an animated avatar was created. If you touch the avater she mutters a spell. Additionally, the cauldron/potion, the oven, and the cat all make noises when you approach them and all potions make a clinking noise when you grab or touch them. There are also a kiosk that transports you to different views of the scene. You can travel to get a view of the rides from the floor, to the tickets, to the coffee shop, and to the snack area. Additionally, you can pick up ice crea, cotton candy, the cotton candy machine, sugar skulls, and popcorn. There's also various attractions to view
